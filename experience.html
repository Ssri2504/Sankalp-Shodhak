      <h2>Our Experience</h2>
      <p>
        At Sankalp Shodhak, we are proud of our achievements in various
        competitive events. We have won many events, which include:
      </p>
      <h3>Pitch-O-Perfect Description</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- Pitch-O-Perfect Description -->
        <strong>Pitch-O-Perfect</strong> is a prestigious college-level
        competition hosted by the Eureka event, organized by the E-Cell at IIT
        Bombay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team proudly emerged as the winner at the college level, showcasing
        our innovative idea that captivated the jury.
      </p>
      <p>
        We presented the <strong>Nyay Sahayak Application</strong>, a platform
        designed to connect individuals with experienced lawyers, streamline
        legal processes, and enhance access to justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The positive feedback from the jury affirmed our commitment to creating
        impactful solutions in the legal domain, making a significant mark in
        the entrepreneurial landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        These accomplishments reflect our commitment to innovation and
        excellence in our projects and initiatives.
      </p>
      <h3>SIH Internal Hackathon Description</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>SIH Internal Hackathon</strong> is a prestigious event that
        fosters innovation and problem-solving among participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this hackathon, our team had the opportunity to present two
        groundbreaking projects: the <strong>Bail Reckoner</strong> and the
        <strong>Water Footprint</strong> application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Bail Reckoner</strong> is designed to assist undertrial
        prisoners, legal aid providers, and judicial authorities in streamlining
        the bail process, ensuring that justice is accessible and efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the <strong>Water Footprint</strong> application aims to
        raise awareness about water consumption by providing users with insights
        into the water used in various products and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both projects received positive feedback from the judges, affirming our
        commitment to leveraging technology for social good and creating
        solutions that address critical societal challenges.
      </p>
      <h3>Solve the SDG Hackathon Description</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Solve the SDG Hackathon</strong> organized by IIT Madras is a
        significant platform aimed at addressing the United Nations Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs) through innovative solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team proudly participated in this competitive event and emerged as
        the <strong>runner-up</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the hackathon, we focused on the critical topic of
        <strong>decarbonizing heavy vehicles</strong>, a pressing issue in the
        quest for sustainable transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our project aimed to develop a viable solution that reduces carbon
        emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, which are major contributors to air
        pollution and climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        By leveraging advanced technologies and innovative design principles, we
        sought to create a more environmentally friendly alternative for the
        transportation industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our solution was well-received by the judges, highlighting our
        dedication to sustainability and the urgent need for effective
        strategies to combat climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        This recognition further motivates us to continue working towards
        impactful projects that align with the global sustainability agenda.
